# PostCSS for Everyone

> PostCSS is often incorrectly compared to css pre-processors, but it is so much more. PostCSS parses CSS into an abstract syntax tree and passes it to plugins for manipulation. The PostCSS plugin ecosystem is rich and growing, providing everything from traditional preprocessing features like variables and nesting to auto vendor prefixing and analysis tools. PostCSS can be used independantly or as a part of your build system. For existing projects, PostCSS can also be used in conjunction with your current pre-processor setup. If you are writing CSS, and have a NodeJS environment, you should be using PostCSS.

I gave this talk at [InRythm U](http://www.meetup.com/InRhythmU/) for their meetup on January 20, 2016.

I'm generating this presentation with [DeckSet](http://www.decksetapp.com). Because of Deckset's custom markdown, it looks a little weird in Github. Sorry about that. Slides will be posted on _the Internet_ somewhere.
